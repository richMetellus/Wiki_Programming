    Abstraction 
      is to distill a system to its most fundamental parts. 

    Access Modifiers 
    Access Specifiers
      Access Modifiers (or access specifiers) are keywords in object-oriented languages that 
      set the accessibility of classes, methods, and other members. Access modifiers are a 
      specific part of programming language syntax used to facilitate 
      the encapsulation of components.

    Abstract Data Type
    ADT
      An ADT is a model of a data structure that specifies the type of data stored, 
      the operations supported on them, and the types of parameters of the operations

      * An ADT specifies what each operation does, but not how it does it. 
      
    Class
      is the building block of OOP that serves as the the primary means 
      for abstraction of an object.

      * An abstract class also cannot be instantiated, but it can define one or more common methods
        that all implementations of the abstraction will have.

    :term:`compiler` 
      is a program that translates the high-level code 
      into machine code, while an interpreter executes the code line by line.

    Constructor
      constructor is  method provided to user as a way to instantiate a class (using the ``new`` operator 
      some programming languages) and whose **responsibility** is 

      * to establish the state of a newly object with appropriate initial values for its 
        instance variables

    Interface
      An interface is a collection of method declarations with no data and no bodies

      * Interfaces do not have constructors and they cannot be directly instantiated
      * When a class implements an interface, it must implement all of the methods declared 
        in the interface.
    
    :term:`interpreter` 
      
      * is a computer program that directly executes instructions written in a 
        programming or scripting language, without requiring them previously to 
        have been compiled into a machine language program.
      * an interpreter executes the code line by line.

    Lvalue
        Lvalue and Rvalue refer to the left and right side of the assignment operator.
        
        Lvalue

        * The requirement that the operand on the **left** side of the assignment operator is modifiable,
          usually a variable.
        
        * examples `here <https://press.rebus.community/programmingfundamentals/chapter/lvalue-and-rvalue/>`_

    Object-oriented programming
      is a programming paradigm based on the concept of  "classes" and "objects", which can contain data and code: 
      data in the form of fields, and code, in the form of procedures.

    Rvalue
        Lvalue and Rvalue refer to the left and right side of the assignment operator.

        Rvalue

        * Pulls or fetches the value stored in a variable or constant.
        * pulls or fetches the value of the expression or operand on the **right** side of the 
          assignment operator
        
        * examples `here <https://press.rebus.community/programmingfundamentals/chapter/lvalue-and-rvalue/#:~:text=An%20lvalue%20refers%20to%20an,the%20expression%20that%20uses%20it.>`_

    Structures

      another tool for grouping several related variables of **same or different type** together.
      Each variable in the structure is known as a member of the structure.

    
    Programming Languages
    programming languages
      programming languages are essentially a set of instructions that a 
      computer understands.

      * A mean of instructing computers to perform a specific task

    Public Interface
      The collective set of behaviors supported by an ADT
