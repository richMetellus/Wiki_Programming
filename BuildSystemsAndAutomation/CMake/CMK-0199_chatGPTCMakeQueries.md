## Conditional variable set:

**Prompt**:
in cmake, how to set a variable named `DTC_OVERLAY_FILE` to a value if the 
condition variable string BOARD is equal to `my_board`?

**chatGPT**
To set the variable `DTC_OVERLAY_FILE` to a specific value based on a condition 
in CMake, you can use an `if` statement combined with the `string` command. 
Here's an example of how you can achieve this:

```cmake
if(BOARD STREQUAL "my_board")
    set(DTC_OVERLAY_FILE "path/to/my_overlay.dts")
endif()
```

In this example, we check if the `BOARD` variable is equal to `"my_board"` using 
the `STREQUAL` operator. If the condition is true, we set the `DTC_OVERLAY_FILE` 
variable to the desired value, such as `"path/to/my_overlay.dts"`. If the 
condition is false, the variable will not be modified.

You can place this code snippet in your CMakeLists.txt file at the appropriate 
location, depending on where you want to set the `DTC_OVERLAY_FILE` variable. 
Note that the condition is case-sensitive, so ensure that the value of `BOARD` 
matches exactly with `"my_board"`.

**Prompt**
change the logic to NOT Equal

**chatGPT**:

If you want to set the `DTC_OVERLAY_FILE` variable to a specific value when the 
`BOARD` variable is NOT equal to `"my_board"`, you can modify the `if` statement 
as follows:

```cmake
if(NOT BOARD STREQUAL "my_board")
    set(DTC_OVERLAY_FILE "path/to/other_overlay.dts")
endif()
```

In this modified example, we use the `NOT` keyword to negate the condition. So, 
if the `BOARD` variable is NOT equal to `"my_board"`, the `DTC_OVERLAY_FILE` 
variable will be set to `"path/to/other_overlay.dts"`. If the condition is true, 
the variable will be modified accordingly, otherwise, it will remain unchanged.

Remember to place this code snippet in the appropriate location in your 
CMakeLists.txt file, based on when and where you want to set the 
`DTC_OVERLAY_FILE` variable.

## Check if a cmake variable is empty 

**Prompt**: 
how to check if a cmake variable such as ZEPHYR_CURRENT_MODULE_DIR is not empty?

**chatGPT**:

To check if a CMake variable, such as `ZEPHYR_CURRENT_MODULE_DIR`, is not empty, 
you can use the `IF` statement and the `NOT` keyword. Here's an example:

```cmake
if(NOT "${ZEPHYR_CURRENT_MODULE_DIR}" STREQUAL "")
    message("ZEPHYR_CURRENT_MODULE_DIR is not empty.")
else()
    message("ZEPHYR_CURRENT_MODULE_DIR is empty.")
endif()
```

In this example, we enclose the `${ZEPHYR_CURRENT_MODULE_DIR}` variable within 
quotes to handle cases where the variable is not defined. The `STREQUAL` 
operator is used to check if the variable is equal to an empty string. If the 
condition evaluates to true, a message is printed indicating that 
`ZEPHYR_CURRENT_MODULE_DIR` is not empty. Otherwise, if the condition evaluates 
to false, a message is printed indicating that `ZEPHYR_CURRENT_MODULE_DIR` is empty.

You can adjust the logic within the `if` statement to perform additional actions 
based on whether the variable is empty or not.
