## Object File create

**Prompt**: 

In a Makefile, what does this target rule does
```
        $(BUILD_DIR)/%.o : %.c $(HEADER)
	        $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -I./ -c $< -o $@
```

**chatGPT**:

The target rule you provided in the Makefile is responsible for compiling C 
source files (`%.c`) into object files (`%.o`). Let's break down the rule step by step:

```
$(BUILD_DIR)/%.o : %.c $(HEADER)
```

This line specifies the target pattern and its dependencies. The target 
pattern is `$(BUILD_DIR)/%.o`, where `$(BUILD_DIR)` represents the build 
directory and `%.o` matches any object file name. The dependency is `%.c`, 
which means that the corresponding C source file must exist. Additionally, `
$(HEADER)` represents the header files that the C source file depends on.

```
$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -I./ -c $< -o $@
```

This line is the recipe that is executed when the target needs to be built. It 
invokes the C compiler (`$(CC)`) with several flags and options:

- `$(CFLAGS)`: These are compiler flags that can be specified to control the 
compilation process. It could include options such as optimization level, 
warnings, and other compiler-specific flags.

- `-I./`: This flag tells the compiler to include the current directory (`./`) 
when searching for header files. It ensures that the compiler can find the 
specified headers (`$(HEADER)`).

- `-c`: This flag tells the compiler to generate an object file from the source 
file, without linking it. It compiles the source file into machine code but 
doesn't create an executable.

- `$<`: This is an automatic variable in Makefiles that represents the first 
dependency (the C source file in this case).

- `-o $@`: This flag specifies the output file name. `$@` is another automatic 
variable that represents the target file name (the object file in this case). 
The compiled object file will be named based on the target pattern (`$(BUILD_DIR)/%.o`).

Overall, this target rule compiles each C source file into an object file using 
the specified compiler (`$(CC)`) and compiler flags (`$(CFLAGS)`). The resulting 
object files will be placed in the build directory (`$(BUILD_DIR)`) with the 
 file names as the source files.

What do the makefile symbols $@ and $< mean?

```
CC=g++
CFLAGS=-c -Wall
LDFLAGS=
SOURCES=main.cpp hello.cpp factorial.cpp
OBJECTS=$(SOURCES:.cpp=.o)
EXECUTABLE=hello

all: $(SOURCES) $(EXECUTABLE)

$(EXECUTABLE): $(OBJECTS)
    $(CC) $(LDFLAGS) $(OBJECTS) -o $@

.cpp.o:
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $< -o $@
```
What do the $@ and $< do exactly?

**Answer**
`$@` is the name of the target being generated, and `$<` the first prerequisite 
(usually a source file). You can find a list of all these special variables in 
the GNU Make manual.

For example, consider the following declaration:

```
all: library.cpp main.cpp
```

In this case:

* `$@` evaluates to all
* `$<` evaluates to library.cpp
* `$^` evaluates to library.cpp main.cpp
